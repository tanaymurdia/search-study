NCT06685666,Effects of Band Exercises Added to the Warm-Up on Shooting and Viscoelastic Properties of Muscles in Handball Players,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06685666,,RECRUITING,"Today's handball has become a fast and fluid handball that expects superior performance from athletes. The aim of handball is to put the ball into the opponent's goal, so one of the most important parameters of sports performance is shooting performance.

Studies show that warm-up programs have a positive effect on sports performance. Warm-up programs are used to prevent possible injuries and to increase sports performance by increasing temperature and flexibility in muscle and connective tissue. Warm-up programs may also cause changes in muscle viscoelastic properties and thus affect performance.

Recently, new approaches have begun to be used in warm-up programs. Some of these are warm-ups with a resistance tire, a medicine ball, and a weight vest. When the literature was examined, the effects of the warm-up program with resistance bands on adolescent handball players were generally examined in the lower extremity, but no study was found examining the effects on the upper extremity. For this reason, the study was designed to examine the effect of elastic band exercises applied to the upper extremity in addition to the traditional warm-up program on shooting performance in adolescent female handball players and the change in the viscoelastic properties of the upper extremity muscle groups.

30 female handball players with an age range of 12-18 years will participate in the research. Athletes will be divided into two equal groups as control and experimental groups in a controlled, randomized manner. The control group will be given a traditional warm-up program 6 days a week for 6 weeks.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has become one of the most effective treatments for PD by implanting electrodes in specific deep brain nuclei to alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients. During the implantation of electrodes in the DBS procedure, small lesions produced are known as the Microlesion Effect, which disappears within a short period. The MLE efficacy is positively correlated with the overall efficacy of DBS, but whether the MLE efficacy is affected by the symptoms has not yet been investigated, and a large-sample study is needed to further validate this. This study aims to examine the relationship between electrode implantation location and the prediction of MLE efficacy produced by STN-DBS surgery in PD patients, assess the correlation between electrode implantation location and DBS efficacy in PD patients, and analyze the role of brain networks in the process. The study will also analyze the relationship between micro-destructive effects and long-term DBS efficacy, providing more effective efficacy prediction and a more accurate selection of electrode implantation locations for DBS treatment in PD patients. This study will guide the clinical practice of DBS treatment in PD patients and provide an important reference for future research in related fields.

To comprehensively analyze the preoperative clinical and imaging characteristics of solid pulmonary nodules, investigate the risk factors associated with malignant solid pulmonary nodules, and provide a reference for preoperative treatment decisions.

Significance of the Study:

According to the 2020 Global Cancer Report, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While the majority of patients with stage I lung cancer achieve long-term survival, survival rates for advanced-stage patients are extremely low. Early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of lung cancer are crucial.

With the widespread implementation of early lung cancer screening, a growing number of pulmonary nodules are being detected, among which solid pulmonary nodules constitute a significant proportion. Unlike ground-glass nodules, accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant solid nodules is critical for determining appropriate treatment strategies. For benign solid nodules, follow-up observation is the preferred approach, whereas early surgical intervention is essential for malignant solid nodules.

Although previous studies have explored the correlation between clinical and imaging characteristics, they have not conducted systematic analyses, and most have been based on small sample sizes. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of preoperative clinical and imaging characteristics, build a predictive model to differentiate between benign and malignant solid pulmonary nodules, and provide a reliable reference for selecting treatment strategies.",NO,Lung Cancer|Solid Pulmonary Nodules|Pulmonary Nodules,OTHER: Preoperative Clinical and Imaging Feature Evaluation for Predictive Modeling,"Diagnostic performance of predictive model, The primary outcome is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the predictive model in distinguishing benign from malignant solid pulmonary nodules, based on preoperative clinical and imaging features., Within 2 years after surgical resection and pathological confirmation",,,The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,320,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,KYLX2024-271,2024-11-15,2025-01-30,2025-02-20,2024-11-12,,2024-11-12,,

NCT06685406,The Validity of Thorathic Fluid Content As Non Invasive Predictor on Weaning of Mechanical Ventilation in Critically Ill Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06685406,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Introduction Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) could be described as the process of removing ventilator support. Weaning from MV often implies two separate but closely linked views of care, elimination of MV of any artificial airway. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is a challenging step during recovery from critical illness (1).

Earlier patient weaning from mechanical ventilation is recommended to avoid complications of prolonged mechanical ventilation; however, premature weaning might result in extubation failure which is associated with poor outcomes (2).

The first step in weaning process is screening patients for readiness to be weaned from mechanical ventilation followed by the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) by checking various indices carefully before starting SBT to ensure adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and airway reflexes (3).

However, a percent of patients fail and are re-intubated despite fulfillment of all the current weaning criteria and this may be due to the heterogeneity of critically ill patients which impairs the predictive accuracy of the available indices in different patient subgroups (4).

Various measures had been previously reported for evaluation of volume status such as fluid balance and echocardiography before the SBT aiming to identify patients who would benefit from diuretic therapy to achieve successful weaning from mechanical ventilation (5).

Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in cardiac factors, such as lung congestion and hypervolemia, as contributing elements in weaning failure and that needs expert physician such as echocardiography (6). So thoracic fluid content measurement may also be beneficial, more accurate and could give us a good idea about weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation (7).

Thoracic fluid content represents the whole (extravascular, intravascular, and intrapleural) fluid component in the thorax; thus, TFC was considered to provide an estimation of the extravascular lung water in absence of significant pleural or pericardial effusion (8,9).

Trans-thoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive tool that delivers bedside cardiac function evaluation. Echocardiography is now widely used to evaluate cardiac function during the ventilator weaning process. Impaired left ventricular systolic and diastolic function were reported to be good predictors of weaning failure (10).

Inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapsibility can give us an idea about hypovolemic patients for estimation of right atrial pressure. Inferior vena cava diameter can be measured using the trans-thoracic echo-cardio graphic subcostal window in the sagittal plane. M-mode imaging allows high-frame rate measurements of size changes throughout the respiratory cycle (11).

Trans-mitral to mitral annular early diastolic velocity ratio (E/Ea ratio) is an echo Doppler non invasive estimation of left ventricular filling pressures and can be measured using trans-thoracic echo-cardiograph in the apical four-chamber view then pulse-wave Doppler imaging is done to record trans-mitral and mitral annular flow in early diastole (12).",NO,Cardiometry|Thorathic Fluid Content|Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Thorathic fluid content measurement by cardiometry,"To assess role of thorathic fluid content measurement by using cardiometry in weaning from mechanical ventilation, 6 months",,,Zagazig University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,120,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,642/8 sep-2024,2024-09-20,2024-09-20,2025-03-21,2024-11-12,,2024-11-12,"Faculty of medicine, zagazig university, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt",

With the TQHPI, mesial, distal, and mid surfaces of facial and lingual aspects were scored:

0 = no plaque/debris

1. = separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth.
2. = a thin continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth.
3. = a band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than one-third of the crown of the tooth.
4. = plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth.
5. = plaque covering two-thirds or more of the crown of the tooth. The index for the tooth was calculated by adding the scores from the six surfaces of the tooth and dividing them by six. For each patient, a plaque index was calculated by adding up the indices for each of the teeth examined and dividing by the number of these teeth., 3 months|clinical measurement of sulcular bleeding index (SBI)., In 1971, Muhlemann \& Son introduced the SBI, which was defined as follows:

Score 0 gingiva of normal texture and color, no bleeding. Score 1: gingiva normal, bleeding on probing. Score 2: bleeding on probing, change in color, no edema. Score 3: bleeding on probing change in color, slight oedema. Score 4: either: (a) bleeding on probing, change in color, obvious edema or (b) bleeding on probing, obvious edema.

Score 5: bleeding on probing and spontaneous bleeding, change in color, marked edema., 3 months|clinical measurement of Probing depth (PD)., For all groups, the pocket depth measurement was calculated from the gingival margin to the base of the pocket in each quadrant between the first premolar and 1ST molar. It was taken at 6 locations which were mesiofacial, midfacial, distofacial, mesiolingual, midlingual, and distolingual.

To the closest millimeter, the standard William's graded probe was employed. It was inserted parallel to the tooth's long axis with light force; if present, any heavy calculus deposits interfering with measurement were removed.

The measurements were put together before being divided by six to determine the mean value of every tooth.

Following that, the pocket depth value for each patient was calculated by summing the values of all teeth, and then the total number of teeth tested divided by the sum., 3 months|clinical measurement of Clinical attachment level (CAL)., For all groups, in each quadrant CAL is measured from the first premolar to the 2nd molar(in mm). By recording six values for every tooth and dividing them by six, the mean value for each tooth was determined. Then, by dividing the total number of teeth inspected by the sum of teeth, we got the mean value of CAL for each patient. If the CEJ landmark is missing because it has been destroyed by dental caries or has been removed by placement of a dental restoration, another fixed reference point can be used to measure attachment loss. Such landmarks might include the apical margin of a restoration or the incisal edge of a tooth. When attachment loss measurements are taken from a fixed landmark other than the CEJ they are called relative attachment loss measurements. Clinical attachment loss or relative attachment loss measurements are the best way to assess the presence or absence of additional periodontal damage, 3 months","MICROBIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, Both periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Prevotella intermedia (PI) were detected within subgingival dental plaque samples at baseline before treatment, 6th, and 12th weeks by semiquantitative culture technique, and the resulting bacteria were identified using (PCR).• Quantification of each organism was done by counting the number of colonies forming units (CFU) on each plate. Because dilutions are based on 1 paper point, the plate count times the dilution factor yielded the total number of organisms per paper point A significant reduction was considered when the CFU/paper point decreased to ≤103; a non-significant reduction was considered when the CFU/paper point was 103-105; and a failure of treatment was considered when the CFU/paper point remained ≥105., 3 months",,ELsabbahy Ahmed Mohamed Youssef,,ALL,ADULT,NA,40,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",A11060722,2023-01-05,2023-12-20,2024-03-25,2024-11-12,,2024-11-12,"Faculty of Dentistry, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Dakahlia, Egypt, 35516, Egypt",
NCT06685380,Cognitive Control During Sleep: the Strange Case of Self-Awakening,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06685380,SAS,RECRUITING,"The experimental model of self-awakening highlights several important issues, particularly the lack of a reliable model for estimating the time interval, from minutes to hours, that passes between falling asleep at night and the moment of self-awakening. This may be explained by limited knowledge of ultradian brain oscillators (i.e., biorhythms with periods shorter than 24 hours) related to the perception of time during nighttime sleep, although the processes involved in the internal timing of circadian rhythms have been extensively studied. These are biologically regulated by a relatively small group of around 10,000 neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, oscillating with a 24-hour rhythm.

Little is known about ultradian timekeepers of sleep, especially related to the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep cycle, but they likely play a crucial role in self-awakening. So far, self-awakening has been studied using various subjective and objective methodologies, including questionnaires, sleep diaries, actigraphy, and polysomnography. However, no study has integrated all these different approaches Objective The primary aim of this project will be to investigate the psychophysiological and neuropsychophysiological characteristics underlying the phenomenon of self-awakening, introducing an innovative multimodal approach by combining three main methodologies (ecological assessment, neuropsychological approach, and polysomnographic recording). Specifically, the first part of the study will aim to confirm, through an actigraphic survey, that subjects who report this ability at a subjective level (evaluated via the SAQ questionnaire) are indeed capable of performing it. Secondly, the polysomnographic study will aim to evaluate the EEG characteristics of 'self-awakeners' in the 30 minutes preceding self-awakening, compared to those preceding forced awakening caused by an external stimulus. Finally, the neuropsychological assessment will aim to evaluate differences in the cognitive control domains and temporal estimation abilities in 'self-awakeners' compared to subjects unable to self-awaken.

The hypothesis is that subjects capable of self-awakening will exhibit distinctive neurophysiological and neuropsychological characteristics. In particular, these subjects are expected to show a reduction in the density and power of slow waves starting 30 minutes before self-awakening, thus indicating the ability to inhibit deep sleep in preparation for wakefulness.

Given the higher prevalence of heart failure (HF) in the elderly population, testing the screening strategy is imperative to customize it to the specific needs of vulnerable patients who may be more inclined to decline participation in the screening program.",NO,Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFPEF),,"The primary objective of this study is to pilot the identification and screening procedures outlined in this protocol., The primary objective of this study is to pilot the identification and screening procedures outlined in this protocol.

However, its prominent drawback is circulatory depression. Our research team previously proposed an individualized dosing method for the titration of propofol. We then compared the effects of different titration rates of propofol on hemodynamics and stress during general anesthesia induction. It was found that the incidence of hypotension during the induction period was lower in the 0.5 mg/kg/min group, with lower stress levels and faster postoperative recovery. However, this group still had a 25.3% incidence of hypotension. Therefore, we plan to further study the differences in hemodynamics, depth of anesthesia, stress response, and postoperative recovery in three groups of patients induced with a constant infusion rate of propofol at 0.5 mg/kg/min titrated to an OAA/S score of 1, an OAA/S score of 2, and BIS ≤ 60, combined with remifentanil 2 μg/kg.

NCT06685055,Markers of Favorable Response to FcRn Inhibitors(INFORM),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06685055,INFORM,RECRUITING,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neurological disease caused by autoantibodies primarily directed against components of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Approximately 85% of patients have antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR).

Anti-AChR antibodies act through three distinct mechanisms:

1. Activation of the classical complement pathway: Formation of membrane-attack complexes (MACs) results in the destruction of the postsynaptic membrane.
2. Mechanical blockade: Anti-AChR antibodies block the acetylcholine binding site on its receptor.
3. Internalization and lysosomal degradation: Bivalent IgG causes cross-linking of adjacent receptors leading to internalization and degradation of AChRs (antigenic modulation).

Patient mortality has significantly reduced due to effective treatments preventing severe exacerbations of myasthenic symptoms.

In the past five years, the FDA and EMA have approved complement inhibitors and FcRn inhibitors for treating generalized myasthenia gravis with anti-AChR antibodies. Many other therapies are currently in phase 3 clinical trials or under regulatory review. However, there is no specific evidence to support which patients benefit most from one treatment class over another.

Given their relative efficacy compared to conventional therapies and high costs, their future role in the therapeutic arsenal is unclear. A personalized approach considering the different pathogenic mechanisms of anti-AChR and single gene polymorphisms involved in treatment response is essential for effective therapeutic choice. In July 2023, AIFA approved the reimbursement of Efgartigimod in Italy for treating adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis with anti-AChR antibodies, in addition to standard therapy.

FcRn inhibitors (including Efgartigimod) prevent the interaction of IgG with the neonatal Fc receptor for immunoglobulin fragments, reducing IgG recycling and promoting the degradation of IgG and pathogenic antibodies without affecting albumin levels.

There is heterogeneity among patients in their response to FcRn inhibitors therapies. Currently, there is no specific evidence indicating which patients may benefit most from this class of treatments.

Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (TF-CBT) is an effective treatment for PTSD and is currently recommended by the National Institute For Health and Social Care Excellence (NICE) as the first line of clinical treatment. During therapy, clients with PTSD revisit the trauma memory to process what has occurred. This technique is known as Imaginal Exposure (IE) which can be a difficult process. Clients can be highly avoidant and emotionally distant from trauma memories, making it challenging to engage with the exposure process. When trauma has occurred several decades previously, traumatic memories may be difficult to access, resulting in poor treatment outcomes.

Technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) can aid this process, as patients can enter a world that exposes them to the traumatic memory in a controlled therapeutic way which has shown to be effective in the treatment of PTSD. VR is yet to be used in routine clinical settings. We are proposing to create low-cost VR environments via 360° video and a new process called VR Photoscan, which will allow a clinical setting to use this beneficial tool to support patients who are receiving TF-CBT to treat PTSD.

This is a three-arm intervention feasibility study using a mixed methods evaluation framework designed to explore the acceptability of low-cost VR as an adjunct within existing TF-CBT therapy.

Group one (N=5) to use 360° Video alongside standard TF-CBT. Group two (N=5) to use VR Photo Scan alongside standard TF-CBT. Group three (N=5) is a control group that will only receive TF-CBT.

The individuals selected for the technological interventions will be offered the opportunity of a personalized 360° video / VR Photoscan environment to aid their therapy session. Pre and post-measures will be collected from participants and semi-structured interviews will be held with participants at the end of their therapy and with the clinicians who have delivered the intervention. This protocol aims to investigate the potential of low-cost VR technology in supporting PTSD treatment, addressing both the practical and theoretical challenges of immersive trauma therapy. By examining the feasibility of 360° video and VR Photoscan, the study hopes to contribute valuable insights into VR's applicability in clinical mental health settings.",NO,PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,BEHAVIORAL: 360 Video|BEHAVIORAL: VR Photoscan|BEHAVIORAL: Standard TF-CBT,"PCL 5 - Measure for PTSD, The PCL-5 is a 20 item self-report scale that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD and usually takes 5-10 minutes to complete. DSM-5 symptoms cluster severity scores can be obtained by summing the scores for the items within a given cluster i.e. Intrusion (5 items); avoidance (2 items); negative alteration in cognitions and mood (7 items) and alterations in arousal and reactivity (6 items). These items are rated on a 4-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) and are based on the participants experiences over the past month. Interpretation of the PCL-5 is made by the clinician and includes a total symptom severity score range 0-80 by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made using this scale and research suggests a PCL-5 cut off score between 31-33 is indicative of probable PTSD., From enrolment to the end of treatment approx. week 16|ITQ - International Trauma Questionnaire, The ITQ is an 18-question self-report measure that focuses on the core features of PTSD and Complex PTSD. All ITQ items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). Scores are calculated for each symptom allowing clinicians to assess both PTSD and C-PTSD symptom severity. Higher scores typically indicate greater severity of trauma-related symptoms., From enrolment to the end of treatment approx. week 16","Beck Depression Inventory-II, This tool is widely used to screen for depressive disorders and to measure the severity of depression. If appropriate, the clinician will administer at baseline and again post-therapy. The BDI-II includes 21 items, each of which corresponds to a symptom of depression and the maximum score is 63. For the BDI-II, a score of 10 to 18 indicates mild depression, and 30 or above indicates severe depression., From enrolment to the end of treatment approx. week 16|Igroup Presence Questionnaire, IPQ is a subjective measure of presence in VR with high validity and internal consistency (α=.85) among virtual game players. The questionnaire includes 14 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from -3 (fully disagree) to +3 (fully agree) to measure a) spatial presence-a perception of being in the VR environment b) involvement-attention within the virtual environment and realness-how realistic the VR appears. Higher scores in a specific domain indicate a stronger presence., This measure will be given at the end of the first session where 360° video or VR Photoscan technology has been used. Approx. week 4|Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), CORE-OM make up a battery of self-report has 34 items designed to measure change due to psychological therapies and address wellbeing, problems, functioning and risk which takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. CORE-OM shows high internal consistency in clinical populations, all domains show appropriate internal validity i.e., α of \>0.75 and \<0.95. The items rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) and 5 (most or all of the time). In this study, CORE-OM will be used as another base line measure and taken again post treatment. Session by session outcome measures will also be taken and the shorter version CORE-10 which takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. This process (i.e., CORE-OM as base line measure and CORE-10 at each session) is recommended in research. Higher scores typically indicate greater impairment or worse outcomes., From enrolment to the end of treatment approx. week 16|Measurement of Subjective Unit of Distress Scale (SUDS), SUDS ratings are commonly used during exposure tasks in CBT for anxiety disorders. SUDS is used to indicate subjective perception of distress on a scale ranging from 0 (no distress) to 100 (extreme distress). During the VR sessions, clinicians will verbally ask clients their SUDS levels at 2-3 time points during the exposure. This will be recorded on a bespoke SUD's worksheet. At the end of the session, clinicians will also ask two short questions - 'Was there anything you liked about the VR experience? And was there anything you didn't like?, This measure will be used during the sessions in which 360° video or VR Photoscan technology has been used. Approx. Week 4-8|United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) Scale, This measure is solely for the clinicians delivering the intervention. The UTAUT is a theoretical model developed to explain and predict the adoption and use of technology by individuals within organisations and other settings. It was created in 2003 and combines elements from several established technology acceptance theories. This model is often used in research to assess user attitudes and predict technology adoption in various fields, such as healthcare, education, and business. Higher scores in each of the constructs of the UTAUT model are generally considered better as they indicate positive perceptions and attitudes towards the technology., Clinicians will complete a pre measure prior to enrolment and post, once they have completed the intervention using both arms of the technology.

NCT06684912,Acute Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Flow Mediated Slowing and Flow Mediated Dilation in Adults with and Without Type 2 Diabetes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06684912,ARM WRESTLING,COMPLETED,"The endothelium is a protective lining of cells inside blood vessels. It keeps blood vessels working smoothly by controlling how wide or narrow your blood vessels are and protecting them from damage. Normally, the endothelium keeps a healthy balance between signals that relax or tighten blood vessels. But with advancing age or certain diseases like diabetes, this balance is disrupted. This can make blood vessels weaker and lead to serious problems in the heart and other organs.

Researchers use a test called brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) to check how well blood vessels work. FMD shows how good blood vessels are at making a chemical called nitric oxide (NO), which helps them relax and widen. During the FMD test, researchers reduce blood flow for a short time with a blood pressure cuff, then release it to see how blood vessels respond. They use an ultrasound machine to measure this. While FMD is useful, it has some downsides-it's hard to do right, needs expensive tools, and experts don't always agree on how to analyze the results. A newer method called flow-mediated slowing (FMS) aims to fix these problems. FMS uses pulse wave velocity (PWV) to measure how stiff your blood vessels are. Stiffer vessels mean less nitric oxide and a higher chance of heart problems. After reducing blood flow with a blood pressure cuff and releasing it, healthy people show a drop in PWV (reduction in arterial stiffness), but people with heart failure or high blood pressure do not. Thus, FMS holds promise as it is an easier way to measure blood vessel health.

Exercise training helps keep blood vessels healthy with advancing age. Research has shown that regular aerobic exercise, (running or biking), and strength exercise (lifting weights), can improve how blood vessels work and make them less stiff. This is true even for healthy people. For people with type 2 diabetes, exercise training is even more important to preserve blood vessel health. The intensity of exercise may determine how much blood vessels improve. Research has shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-where you switch between hard exercise and rest-works better than steady, moderate exercise for making blood vessels healthier and less stiff. It is thought that HIIT improves blood vessel health partly by improving how the body uses insulin. Still, not all studies show that training improves blood vessel health in people with type 2 diabetes.

A single session of exercise presents a challenge to blood vessels that allows researchers to understand how exercise over time improves blood vessel health. In addition, studying how blood vessels react to one workout (called the acute exercise model) is helpful because researchers can easily control things like the type of exercise, how hard it is, or how long it lasts. Acute exercise research also helps control other factors, such as nutrition, that may bias results. Thus, acute exercise research is a great method to learn how exercise works in the short term and how it might help in the long run.

Therefore, the present study aimed to determine how FMD and FMS respond after an acute bout of high-intensity interval exercise and moderate continuous exercise in older adults without type 2 diabetes, and also healthy young adults.

The key research questions were:

1. Is the FMD and FMS response after an acute bout of exercise dependent on exercise intensity?
2. Is the FMD and FMS response after an acute bout of exercise dependent on age and disease status?

All participants were asked to:

Complete two exercise sessions - one moderate- and one high-intensity interval bout on a treadmill. The order of the sessions was randomly assigned, similar to flipping a coin.

FMD and FMS were measured before and after each acute exercise bout in the laboratory.

Pylori,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06684860,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The rapid urease test (RUT) is frequently performed for diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in clinical practice. The RUT is a simple and inexpensive method that utilizes a commercial kit containing urea and a pH indicator such as phenol red. In the presence of H. pylori urease, urea is hydrolyzed to ammonia, which raises the pH of the medium, and changes the color of the kit from yellow to magenta or pink. The sensitivity and specificity of RUT were reported to range between 80-100% and 97-99%, respectively. When endoscopy is performed, RUT is known as the first-line method used for H. pylori diagnosis. However, RUT is an indirect test method, and has the disadvantage of causing false positivity due to other urease-producing bacteria.

To date, gold standards for H. pylori diagnosis are culture and histological examination Because H. pylori is a rather fastidious and slow-growing bacterium, antimicrobial susceptibility testing using culture methods is time-consuming (10-14 days) and requires specific expertise. Recently, dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO)-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to diagnose H. pylori infection. Moreover, molecular testing can identify point mutations related to clarithromycin resistance. It can be performed in a standard thermocycler and takes only 4 h to complete.

NCT06684834,Intermittent Carbohydrate Restriction in Cardiometabolic Health,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06684834,,RECRUITING,"Metabolic conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, are among the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Identifying innovative lifestyle strategies to reduce metabolic risk remains a public health priority. Further research is essential to understand how low carbohydrate intake influences human metabolism and how intermittent carbohydrate restriction impacts weight loss and metabolic health markers.

This study will investigate two interventions that restrict dietary carbohydrate intake on different schedules, examining their effects on metabolic health and energy balance in adults with abdominal overweight or obesity. The physiological mechanisms potentially underlying these effects will be explored by measuring a range of lifestyle and metabolic health parameters in both free-living and laboratory settings. A digital behaviour-change intervention will be incorporated after the dietary intervention to assess whether any metabolic effects can be sustained over time.

The study employs a three-arm parallel-group design consisting of a two-week lifestyle monitoring phase, a four-week dietary intervention, and a four-week digital intervention, with four laboratory visits throughout each phase. During the dietary intervention, participants will be allocated to one of three groups: (i) carbohydrate restriction (\<8% of energy intake) on two consecutive days per week, (ii) carbohydrate restriction after 4 pm each day, or (iii) no dietary changes.

NCT06684561,EARLY FEASIBILITY STUDY: SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PHOTON INFUSION SET,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06684561,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Study 1:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of Photon infusion sets (PIS) with new PFAS-free cannula (catheter) in adult patients with Type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days and 6 hours.

This is a 1-center, prospective, open-label, 1-arm study with type 1 patients with diabetes on 780G insulin pump therapy with Guardian™ 4 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM). All subjects will be instructed to change infusion sets every 246 hours (10 days \& 6 hours) or at set failure. Each subject is required to wear the CGM device continuously.

After completing 2 sets, the subjects have an optional office visit to download pump and CGM data and will continue to additional two wears. At day 40 or after using 4 completed wears of infusion sets (Note: early infusion set failure with wear time of \<6 hours due to insertion failure will be reported, yet not accounted as completed wear), the patients will return to a visit, download pump and CGM data, and end the study.

Photon infusion sets with 6-mm and 9-mm cannula length will be supplied for this study, with selection based on subjects' needs and doctor's recommendation. Subjects will change insulin reservoirs at least every 7 days (the labelled wear duration of the Extended reservoir). The infusion set(s) or reservoir(s) can be replaced independent of each other. The date and time of each infusion set insertion will be recorded in a Daily Log (Diary) which will include the causes of early removal, if occurs.

NCT06684548,Effect of Hip/Shoulder-Width Ratio on Sensory Blockade After Intrathecal Anesthesia for Adult Subumblical Herniorraphy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06684548,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Spinal anesthesia is a straightforward and reliable technique frequently employed in lower body surgeries, achieving adequate surgical conditions through the injection of a small amount of local anesthetic (LA) into the intrathecal space . One advantage of spinal anesthesia over general anesthesia is reduced exposure to potentially depressant drugs . However, inadequate spinal spread can result in pain and discomfort for patients and complicate surgical procedures . Consequently, anesthesiologists encounter the challenge of attaining the proper spread of spinal anesthesia for subumbilical herniorrhaphy due to individual anthropometric variations .

Approximately 25 factors have been identified that affect the spread of spinal anesthesia in the subarachnoid space for a given dose of LA . Variables that are both practically obtainable and predictive of spinal anesthesia spread can aid anesthesiologists in anticipating the extent of the block. Among the most studied factors are patient characteristics, injection techniques, patient posture, and the baricity of the LA .

Research has examined various patient variables affecting spinal anesthesia spread, including age , weight , height , gender, patient position, BMI , vertebral column length (VCL), and abdominal circumference . Body morphometrics such as the hip-shoulder width ratio (HSWR) have garnered attention for their potential impact on the distribution of anesthetic agents within the intrathecal space .

The study will be conducted at Assiut University Hospitals and will include patients aged 18 or older receiving anthracycline-based treatments (3+7 regimen for AML and CHOP regimen for NHL).

The background highlights that anthracyclines, a class of chemotherapeutic agents, can cause serious side effects, particularly cardiotoxicity. The research aims to investigate whether atorvastatin, a statin used to lower cholesterol, can mitigate this risk by improving cardiac function in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The study will be a randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 46 participants. It will assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as the primary outcome to determine the effect of atorvastatin on reducing cardiotoxicity. Secondary outcomes include identifying high-risk patients and further understanding the impact of atorvastatin.
